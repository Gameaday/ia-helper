## [Unreleased]

### Bug Fixes & Improvements (2025-10-09)

#### Fixed
- **Thumbnail CDN URLs on Web** - All thumbnails now use official `/download/` endpoint
  - Changed ArchiveMetadata to ALWAYS use `urlService.getThumbnailUrl()`
  - Stopped using `misc.image` field from API (contains CDN redirect paths)
  - API returns paths like `/24/items/id/__ia_thumb.jpg` which redirect to CDN
  - Now bypasses API's CDN redirects and uses standardized endpoint directly
  - Eliminates ALL CORS errors on web for thumbnails
  - Consistent thumbnail loading across all platforms

- **Identifier Validation False Positives** - Search bar no longer shows "Open Archive" button for non-existent identifiers
  - Added `ArchiveService.validateIdentifier()` method with HEAD request validation
  - IntelligentSearchBar now validates identifiers before showing actions
  - Shows loading indicator during validation (500ms debounce)
  - Displays validation status: "Checking...", "Valid archive", or "Archive not found"
  - "Open Archive" button only enabled for validated identifiers
  - Prevents false positives for queries like "mario", "test", etc.
  - Fixes user-reported issue #8

- **Collection Save Messages** - Collection picker now shows accurate feedback
  - Fixed incorrect "Removed from collections" message when no collections selected
  - Messages now based on actual changes (toAdd/toRemove sets)
  - Four cases handled: "No changes", "Added to X", "Removed from X", "Updated (added X, removed Y)"
  - Fixes user-reported issue #6

- **Favorites Not Showing** - Library screen now auto-refreshes when tab becomes visible
  - Added AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin to preserve state
  - Added didChangeDependencies() to reload data on visibility
  - Favorites, collections, and downloads update immediately after changes
  - Fixes user-reported issue #5

- **URL Standardization - ALL Platforms** - Unified CDN URL handling across web, mobile, and desktop
  - Removed web-only restriction from ArchiveUrlService.fixCorsUrl()
  - ALL platforms now use official archive.org/download/ endpoint
  - Consistent behavior and reliability across platforms
  - Updated statistics to reflect "url_standardization" and "cdn_rewriting_all_platforms"

#### Improved
- **Home Screen UX** - Cleaner, more intuitive interface
  - Recent searches now shown as rectangular cards (not chips)
  - Removed "Recent Searches" heading text (obvious from context)
  - Limited to 5 searches to fit on screen without scrolling
  - Search prompt (icon + tips) only shows when NO recent searches
  - When user has history: Clean list of recent items
  - When user clears history: Helpful search tips reappear
  - Better use of vertical space and visual hierarchy
  - Swipe to dismiss still works on recent search cards

#### Technical Details
- ~200 lines modified across 2 files (archive_metadata.dart, home_screen.dart)
- ~140 lines added for identifier validation (archive_service.dart, intelligent_search_bar.dart)
- Zero compilation errors (flutter analyze clean)
- Material Design 3 compliant validation UI with loading states
- Debounced validation (500ms) to reduce API calls
- 5-second timeout on validation requests
- All changes tested and verified
