# Fixing the Flutter Web App on GitHub Pages

**Problem:** https://gameaday.github.io/ia-helper/app/ is not working  
**Status:** üîç Diagnosis needed  
**Date:** October 8, 2025

---

## ‚úÖ Local Build is Now Fixed

The web app now builds correctly with proper base-href:

```bash
flutter build web --release --no-tree-shake-icons --base-href="/ia-helper/app/"
```

**Verification:**
```bash
Get-Content build\web\index.html | Select-String -Pattern "base href"
# Result: <base href="/ia-helper/app/">  ‚úÖ Correct!
```

---

## üîç Diagnosing the Deployed Site Issue

### Step 1: Check if GitHub Pages is Enabled

**Most Likely Cause:** GitHub Pages is not enabled in repository settings.

**How to check:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/Gameaday/ia-helper/settings/pages
2. Look under "Build and deployment"
3. **Required setting:** Source must be set to **"GitHub Actions"**

**If it says "None" or "Deploy from a branch":**
- This is the problem! The workflow can't deploy without this setting.
- **Fix:** Change source to "GitHub Actions" and save

---

### Step 2: Check if Workflow Has Run

**Check workflow runs:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/Gameaday/ia-helper/actions
2. Look for "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Check the status of recent runs

**Expected workflow status:**
- ‚úÖ **All green checks:** Deployment successful, GitHub Pages setting issue
- ‚ùå **Red X:** Workflow failed, need to check logs
- ‚ö™ **No runs:** Workflow hasn't been triggered yet

**If no workflow runs:**
```bash
# Push a commit to trigger deployment
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Rebuild web app with correct base-href"
git push origin main
```

---

### Step 3: Check Workflow Logs (If Failed)

If the workflow has red X's:

1. Click on the failed workflow run
2. Click on "build-and-deploy" job
3. Look for errors in these steps:
   - "Build Web (no icon tree-shaking)" - Should succeed
   - "Upload to GitHub Pages" - Needs GitHub Pages enabled
   - "Deploy to GitHub Pages" - Most likely to fail if Pages not enabled

**Common errors:**

**Error:** "pages.write permission required"
- **Cause:** GitHub Pages not enabled
- **Fix:** Enable GitHub Pages with "GitHub Actions" source

**Error:** "404 Not Found"
- **Cause:** Pages deployment endpoint not available
- **Fix:** Enable GitHub Pages in settings

---

## üöÄ Complete Fix Guide

### Option A: Quick Test (Already Have Local Build)

Since we just rebuilt the web app correctly, you can test it locally:

```bash
# Serve the web app locally
cd build\web
python -m http.server 8000

# Or use Flutter's serve
flutter run -d web-server --web-port=8000
```

**Test URL:** http://localhost:8000  
(Note: It will look for assets at /ia-helper/app/ which won't work locally, but proves the build is correct)

---

### Option B: Deploy to GitHub Pages (Recommended)

**Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages**
1. Go to https://github.com/Gameaday/ia-helper/settings/pages
2. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: **"GitHub Actions"** (not "Deploy from a branch")
3. Click "Save"

**Step 2: Trigger Deployment**
```bash
# Commit the newly built web app
git add build/web/
git commit -m "fix: Add correctly built web app with base-href"
git push origin main
```

**Step 3: Wait for Deployment**
- Go to: https://github.com/Gameaday/ia-helper/actions
- Watch "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
- Wait ~3-5 minutes for completion

**Step 4: Verify Deployment**
- Visit: https://gameaday.github.io/ia-helper/app/
- Should load the full Flutter web application
- Check browser console (F12) for any errors

---

## üêõ Still Not Working? Advanced Troubleshooting

### Issue: Web App Shows White/Blank Page

**Check 1: Browser Console**
```javascript
// Open browser dev tools (F12)
// Look for errors like:
- "Failed to load resource: 404"
- "main.dart.js:1 Failed to load"
- "flutter_bootstrap.js 404"
```

**If you see 404 errors for assets:**
- Base-href is wrong or assets not deployed
- Check: View page source, verify `<base href="/ia-helper/app/">`

**Check 2: Network Tab**
```javascript
// In dev tools, go to Network tab
// Reload page
// Look at which files are loading:
‚úÖ Should load from: /ia-helper/app/flutter_bootstrap.js
‚ùå Don't want: /flutter_bootstrap.js (wrong base path)
```

---

### Issue: GitHub Actions Workflow Not Visible

**Possible causes:**
1. Workflow file not in correct location
2. YAML syntax error
3. Branch protection rules

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check workflow file exists
Test-Path .github\workflows\deploy-github-pages.yml
# Should return: True

# Check YAML syntax
Get-Content .github\workflows\deploy-github-pages.yml | Select-String -Pattern "on:"
# Should show: on: push: branches: [ main ]
```

---

### Issue: Workflow Runs But Deployment Step Fails

**Error message:** "Error: No uploaded artifact was found!"

**Cause:** Upload step failed or artifact expired

**Fix:**
1. Check "Upload to GitHub Pages" step succeeded
2. Verify `_site` directory was created correctly
3. Re-run workflow

---

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before enabling GitHub Pages, verify:

- [x] Web app builds successfully locally
- [x] Base-href is set to `/ia-helper/app/` in built index.html
- [x] All assets present in `build/web/` directory
- [x] Workflow file at `.github/workflows/deploy-github-pages.yml`
- [x] Workflow has correct build command with quotes
- [ ] **GitHub Pages enabled in repository settings** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- [ ] **Workflow has run successfully** üîÑ
- [ ] **Web app accessible at URL** üéØ

---

## üîß Workflow Command Fix (For Reference)

The GitHub Actions workflow should use this command (Linux bash):

```yaml
- name: Build Web (no icon tree-shaking)
  run: |
    flutter build web --release --no-tree-shake-icons --base-href /ia-helper/app/
```

Note: No quotes needed in bash! The current workflow is correct.

For PowerShell (local testing):
```powershell
flutter build web --release --no-tree-shake-icons --base-href="/ia-helper/app/"
```

Note: Quotes required in PowerShell!

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The web app is working when:

1. ‚úÖ https://gameaday.github.io/ia-helper/app/ loads
2. ‚úÖ No 404 errors in browser console
3. ‚úÖ Flutter app renders with UI visible
4. ‚úÖ Search, Discover, Library features work
5. ‚úÖ Dark mode toggle works
6. ‚úÖ Responsive on mobile and desktop

---

## üéØ Most Likely Solution

Based on your description, the issue is almost certainly:

**GitHub Pages is not enabled in the repository settings.**

**The fix:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/Gameaday/ia-helper/settings/pages
2. Source: **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Save
4. Push a commit to trigger deployment
5. Wait 3-5 minutes
6. Visit https://gameaday.github.io/ia-helper/app/

**Why this is likely the issue:**
- ‚úÖ Workflow file exists and looks correct
- ‚úÖ Web app builds successfully locally
- ‚úÖ Base-href is correct after rebuild
- ‚ùå But GitHub can't deploy without Pages enabled

---

## üìû Next Steps

**Immediate:**
1. Check GitHub Pages settings (link above)
2. If not enabled, enable with "GitHub Actions" source
3. Push this commit to trigger deployment:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: Rebuild web with correct base-href, add deployment guides"
   git push origin main
   ```
4. Monitor: https://github.com/Gameaday/ia-helper/actions
5. Test: https://gameaday.github.io/ia-helper/app/

**If still not working after enabling Pages:**
- Share the workflow run logs
- Share any browser console errors
- We'll debug from there

---

**Current Status:** Ready to deploy! Just needs GitHub Pages enabled. üöÄ
