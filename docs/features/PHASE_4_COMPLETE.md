## Files Removed

### 1. download_screen.dart (842 lines)
- **Replaced by:** `transfers_screen.dart` (927 lines) in Phase 2.2
- **Why removed:** 
  - Transfers screen provides better UX with segmented controls
  - Integrates with bottom navigation (Transfers tab)
  - Shows both active downloads and download queue in one view
  
### 2. download_queue_screen.dart (862 lines)
- **Replaced by:** `transfers_screen.dart` in Phase 2.2
- **Why removed:**
  - Queue functionality now accessible via segmented control
  - No longer need separate screen for queue
  - Better state management with NavigationState

### 3. collections_screen.dart (574 lines)
- **Replaced by:** `library_screen.dart` (829 lines) in Phase 2.1
- **Why removed:**
  - Library screen consolidates collections, downloads, favorites
  - Provides better organization with segmented controls
  - Integrates with bottom navigation (Library tab)

### 4. history_screen.dart (506 lines)
- **Replaced by:** `search_history_sheet.dart` (372 lines) in Phase 2.3
- **Why removed:**
  - History now shown as bottom sheet modal
  - Better UX - doesn't require navigation away from search
  - More accessible from any screen via app bar action

**Total lines removed:** 2,784 lines

---

## Files Modified

### 1. main.dart

**Changes:**
- Removed imports:
  ```dart
  // REMOVED
  import 'screens/download_screen.dart';
  import 'screens/download_queue_screen.dart';
  ```

- Removed route cases:
  ```dart
  // REMOVED from onGenerateRoute switch
  case DownloadScreen.routeName:
    return MD3PageTransitions.fadeThrough(
      page: const DownloadScreen(),
      settings: settings,
    );
  case DownloadQueueScreen.routeName:
    return MD3PageTransitions.fadeThrough(
      page: const DownloadQueueScreen(),
      settings: settings,
    );
  ```

**Result:**
- Cleaner routing logic
- Only keeps routes for screens still used:
  - `ArchiveDetailScreen` - Detail pages
  - `AdvancedSearchScreen` - Complex search UI
  - `SavedSearchesScreen` - Saved searches management
  - `SearchResultsScreen` - Search results display

### 2. download_controls_widget.dart

**Changes:**
- Updated import:
  ```dart
  // OLD
  import '../screens/download_screen.dart';
  
  // NEW
  import '../core/navigation/navigation_state.dart';
  ```

- Updated navigation logic:
  ```dart
  // OLD - Navigate to separate download screen
  Navigator.push(
    context,
    MD3PageTransitions.fadeThrough(
      page: const DownloadScreen(useBackground: true),
    ),
  );
  
  // NEW - Switch to Transfers tab in bottom nav
  final navState = context.read<NavigationState>();
  navState.changeTab(3); // Switch to Transfers tab (index 3)
  Navigator.popUntil(context, (route) => route.isFirst);
  ```

**Result:**
- Better UX - uses bottom navigation instead of pushing new screen
- Consistent with navigation redesign
- Properly uses NavigationState API

## Navigation Mapping

### Old â†’ New Screen Mapping

| Old Screen | Old Route | New Implementation | Access Method |

| DownloadQueueScreen | `/download-queue` | TransfersScreen (Queue tab) | Bottom nav tab 3, segment 1 |
| CollectionsScreen | `/collections` | LibraryScreen (Collections tab) | Bottom nav tab 1, segment 0 |
| HistoryScreen | `/history` | SearchHistorySheet | Modal from app bar action |

### Remaining Routes (Still Valid)

| Screen | Route | Purpose | Access Method |
|--------|-------|---------|---------------|
| ArchiveDetailScreen | `/archive/:id` | Show archive details | Tap search result / library item |
| AdvancedSearchScreen | `/advanced-search` | Complex search interface | App bar action on home screen |
| SavedSearchesScreen | `/saved-searches` | Manage saved searches | Button in search history modal |
| SearchResultsScreen | `/search/results` | Display search results | Submit search query |
