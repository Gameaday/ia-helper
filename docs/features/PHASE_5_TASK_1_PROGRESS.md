# Phase 5 Task 1: Play Store Compliance - Progress Report

**Status**: 95% Complete (5/5 UX subtasks done, visual assets remaining)  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Time Spent**: ~8 hours

## Critical Bug Fixes (October 9, 2025) 🐛

### Archive.org Identifier Validation - COMPLETELY REWRITTEN ✅

**Root Cause Discovered**:
- Archive.org returns HTTP 200 (not 404) for invalid identifiers
- Archive.org returns empty JSON `{}` instead of error response  
- Archive.org HEAD requests return 405 Method Not Allowed
- Previous validator used HEAD request → Always got 405 errors
- Previous validator only checked status code → Never actually validated!

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **archive_service.dart** - `_checkIdentifierExists()`:
   - Changed HEAD → GET request
   - Added JSON response body parsing
   - Check for `metadata`, `files`, or `created` keys in response
   - Return false if response is empty `{}`
   - Proper debug logging with validation reasoning

2. **archive_metadata.dart** - `fromJson()`:
   - Added empty response detection at start of factory
   - Throws `FormatException('Archive item not found or empty response')` for `{}`
   - Prevents construction of invalid objects
   - Fails fast with clear error message

3. **search_result.dart** - `fromJson()`:
   - Added identifier validation (null/empty check)
   - Throws `FormatException('Search result missing valid identifier')`
   - Prevents search results without identifiers from propagating

**Testing Evidence**:
```bash
# Uppercase returns empty JSON:
curl https://archive.org/metadata/Mario → {}

# Lowercase returns full data:
curl https://archive.org/metadata/mario → {"metadata": {...}, "files": [...]}
```

**Impact**: Fixes crashes on invalid identifiers, enables proper "Mario" → "mario" lowercase retry

**Status**: ✅ Compiles cleanly (flutter analyze: 0 errors, 0 warnings)

---

### Comprehensive Codebase Audit ✅

**Objective**: Check all API handlers and data models for similar validation issues

**Files Reviewed**:
- ✅ `lib/services/archive_service.dart` - Validator (FIXED)
- ✅ `lib/models/archive_metadata.dart` - Parsing (HARDENED)
- ✅ `lib/services/internet_archive_api.dart` - API layer (already robust)
- ✅ `lib/models/search_result.dart` - Search parsing (IMPROVED)
- ✅ `lib/services/file_preview_service.dart` - 6 status checks (all safe)
- ✅ `lib/models/archive_metadata.dart` - ArchiveFile.fromJson (safe with defaults)
- ✅ `lib/services/advanced_search_service.dart` - Search handling (proper error handling)

**Key Findings**:
1. **No additional critical bugs found** ✅
2. **All status code checks are appropriate** (200, 304, 404, 403, 5xx)
3. **All fromJson methods handle missing data safely** (defaults or nullables)
4. **Exception propagation works correctly** (FormatException flows up properly)

**Architectural Decisions Documented**:
- **ArchiveMetadata**: Fail-fast on empty JSON (critical API response)
- **SearchResult**: Use defaults for missing fields (search can have partial results)
- **ArchiveFile**: Safe defaults for name, nullables for other fields
- **Preview Services**: Throw exceptions with clear error messages

**Archive.org API Quirks** (for future developers):
- Returns HTTP 200 + `{}` for invalid identifiers (not 404!)
- HEAD requests return 405 Method Not Allowed
- Must use GET and parse response body to validate
- `/services/img/` always redirects to CDN nodes (no CORS headers)
- CDN nodes lack CORS headers (web thumbnail failures unavoidable)
