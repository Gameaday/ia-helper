## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)
1. ‚úÖ Complete Task 1 documentation (DONE)
2. Create visual assets (Task 1.6) OR
3. Begin Task 2.1: Navigation UX redesign (CRITICAL PRIORITY)

### User Decision Point ü§î

**Option A: Complete Task 1 (Visual Assets)**
- Time: 4-6 hours
- Creates complete Play Store listing
- Can submit immediately after
- Blockers: Need design skills, Android device/emulator

**Option B: Start Task 2 (Navigation UX Redesign)** ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
- Time: 8-12 hours
- Fixes critical UX issues (app bar overcrowding)
- Improves user experience significantly
- Should be done before Play Store launch anyway
- Better screenshots after redesign

**Recommendation**: Start Task 2.1 now, complete visual assets after UX redesign. This ensures screenshots show the improved navigation system.

---

## Task 1 Completion Blockers

**Only 1 remaining**: Visual assets (screenshots, icons, graphics)

**Can be unblocked by**:
1. Using Android emulator to take screenshots
2. Using GIMP/Figma to design icons and feature graphic
3. Adding text overlays for feature highlights
4. Estimated effort: 4-6 hours

**However**: Better to redesign navigation first (Task 2.1), then take screenshots of improved UI.
