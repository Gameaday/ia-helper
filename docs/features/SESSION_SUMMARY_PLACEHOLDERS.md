## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Phase 4 Navigation Cleanup - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Problem:** After completing navigation redesign (Phases 1-3), had 4 obsolete screen files and broken routing.

  - `download_screen.dart` (842 lines)
  - `download_queue_screen.dart` (862 lines)
  - `collections_screen.dart` (574 lines)
  - `history_screen.dart` (506 lines)

  - Removed imports for deleted screens
  - Removed route cases for `DownloadScreen.routeName` and `DownloadQueueScreen.routeName`
  - Kept only essential routes
  
- ‚úÖ Fixed `download_controls_widget.dart`:
  - Updated to use `NavigationState` instead of old screen navigation
  - Now switches to Transfers tab using `navState.changeTab(3)`
  - Better UX with consistent bottom navigation

**Verification:**
```
flutter analyze ‚Üí 0 issues ‚úÖ
