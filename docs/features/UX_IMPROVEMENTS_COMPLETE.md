## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Advanced Filter Sort Options Display ‚úÖ

**Problem:** SegmentedButton with 9 sort options caused horizontal overflow, displaying text vertically on mobile screens.

**Solution:**
- Replaced SegmentedButton with hybrid approach:
  - 4 most common options as FilterChips (relevance, date, downloads, weekly views)
  - All 9 options in DropdownButtonFormField with descriptions
- Mobile-friendly, clearly labeled, maintains MD3 design

**Files Changed:**
- `lib/widgets/advanced_filters_sheet.dart`

**Impact:** Much better UX on mobile devices, easier to understand sort options

---

### 2. Created New Discover Screen ‚úÖ

**Problem:** No dedicated discovery interface, only identifier-based search.

**Solution:** Full-featured Discover screen with:
- **Keyword search bar** at top for general queries
- **Advanced search** quick access button
- **6 popular category chips** (Books, Movies, Audio, Software, Images, Web)
- **Trending content grid** showing popular downloads from Internet Archive
- **Quick Favorites** collapsible section (subtle, 5 recent favorites)
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Full MD3 compliance with proper theming and animations

**Files Created:**
- `lib/screens/discover_screen.dart` (408 lines)

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/core/navigation/bottom_navigation_scaffold.dart` (replaced Favorites nav with Discover)

**Impact:** Major improvement in content discoverability, better user engagement

---

### 3. Integrated Keyword Search Functionality ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Home screen only searched by archive identifier, not keywords.

**Solution:**
- Discover screen uses `AdvancedSearchService.search()` for full-text queries
- Category searches pre-configured for each media type
- Proper query building with `SearchQuery` model
- Navigation to `SearchResultsScreen` with complete query support

**Impact:** Users can now search for content by keywords, not just IDs

---

### 4. Moved Favorites to Library Tab ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Favorites occupied a separate bottom nav button, taking valuable space.

**Solution:**
- **Removed Favorites from bottom navigation** (was middle button)
- **Added as 4th tab in Library screen**: Downloads ‚Üí Collections ‚Üí Favorites ‚Üí Recent
- Favorites tab features:
  - List of all favorited archives with media type icons
  - Human-readable date formatting (today, yesterday, X days/weeks/months ago)
  - Quick unfavorite action button
  - Navigation to archive details
  - Empty state with helpful messaging
- **Bottom nav now**: Home ‚Üí Library ‚Üí Discover ‚Üí Transfers ‚Üí Settings

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/screens/library_screen.dart` (+150 lines)
- `lib/core/navigation/bottom_navigation_scaffold.dart`

**Impact:** Cleaner navigation, better organization, Favorites accessible where they belong

---

### 5. Fixed Bandwidth Settings Access ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Bandwidth settings button in Settings used broken `Navigator.pushNamed('/downloads')` route that didn't exist.

**Solution:**
- Replaced with functional bandwidth configuration dialog
- Integrated with `BandwidthManagerProvider`
- 6 preset options with icons and descriptions:
  - üêå 256 KB/s - Very slow, background downloads
  - üêå 512 KB/s - Slow, good for mobile data
  - üö∂ 1 MB/s - Moderate, balanced
  - üèÉ 5 MB/s - Fast, good for multiple downloads
  - üèÉ 10 MB/s - Very fast, high-speed connections
  - üöÄ Unlimited - No bandwidth limit
- Custom radio button UI (to avoid deprecated `RadioListTile` API)
- Saves to `SharedPreferences` for persistence
- Confirmation snackbar after applying

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart` (+80 lines)

**Impact:** Bandwidth limiting now fully functional and user-friendly

---

### 6. Settings Audit for Orphaned Code ‚úÖ

**Findings:**
- ‚úÖ No broken `Navigator.pushNamed` calls remaining
- ‚úÖ No TODO/FIXME comments
- ‚úÖ All settings functional and accessible
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling throughout

**Impact:** Clean, maintainable settings code

---

### 7. Fixed Discover Content Button in Favorites ‚úÖ

**Problem:** "Discover content" button in favorites empty state did nothing.

**Solution:**
- Added helpful snackbar: "Go to Discover tab to find content to favorite"
- Guides users to the new Discover screen
- Future: Can be enhanced to directly switch to Discover tab

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/screens/library_screen.dart`

**Impact:** Empty state now helpful instead of broken

---

### 8. Fixed Critical Web App Build Issue ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Web build failed with error:
```
Error: Avoid non-const invocations of IconData
file:///C:/Project/ia-helper/lib/screens/library_screen.dart:1000:42
```

**Root Cause:** IconData was being instantiated inside widget build method from dynamic collection icon string.

**Solution:**
- Extracted icon parsing to separate helper method `_parseCollectionIcon()`
- Added `--no-tree-shake-icons` flag to build command (already in workflow)
- Web build now succeeds consistently

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/screens/library_screen.dart` (added helper method)
- `.github/workflows/deploy-github-pages.yml` (already had flag)

**Build Status:** ‚úÖ Succeeds  
**Web App URL:** https://gameaday.github.io/ia-helper/app/

**Impact:** Web app now functional and accessible

---

### 9. Updated Build Documentation About Warnings ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Not clear that warnings break CI/CD builds.

**Solution:**
- Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with **CRITICAL** section:
  ```markdown
  ### Flutter Standards
  - **CRITICAL: ANY code warnings from `flutter analyze` WILL break the build in CI/CD**
  - **Always fix ALL warnings before committing - the build pipeline treats warnings as errors**
  - Common warnings that break builds:
    - Non-const IconData invocations (use helper methods or `--no-tree-shake-icons`)
    - Unused imports
    - Deprecated API usage (update to new APIs immediately)
    - Type mismatches
  ```

**Current Status:** 
- ‚úÖ `flutter analyze` - **0 issues found**
- ‚úÖ All deprecation warnings properly fixed
- ‚úÖ Custom UI components to avoid deprecated APIs

**Impact:** Clear documentation prevents future build failures

---

### 10. Added Favorites to Discover Screen ‚úÖ

**Design Philosophy:** Subtle and out of the way, but accessible.

**Implementation:**
- **Collapsible "Quick Favorites" section** before trending content
- Shows recent 5 favorites with expand/collapse control
- Horizontal scrolling chips with media type icons
- Only appears if user has favorites
- Complements (doesn't compete with) trending/search content

**Rationale:**
- Favorites can be downloaded (Library) OR not yet downloaded (Discover)
- Having quick access in Discover helps while browsing new content
- Collapsible design keeps focus on discovery when not needed

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/screens/discover_screen.dart` (+90 lines)

**Impact:** Convenient access to favorites during content discovery

---

### 11. Linked Web App from GitHub Main Page ‚úÖ

**Changes to README.md:**
- **Added prominent Quick Start section** at top with:
  - üåê Launch Web App (direct link)
  - üì• Download Android APK
- **Reorganized Download Options:**
  - Web App section with benefits (no install, cross-platform, etc.)
  - Mobile App section with development builds
  - App Store section (coming soon)
- Clear hierarchy and visual separation

**Impact:** Web app now easily discoverable from main GitHub page
